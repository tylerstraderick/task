### Tasks

The task asked to use minimal third part libraries so I didn't use any (kind of a lie, I used Mockito for testing). I opted to use the Bing API to make the Bing search (Sorry!).
Task 1 in particular would have been more straightforward by using a JSON library, which would have been less work to get the url's.
I ended up moving on from step 3, as when I was trying to get the URL's for the libraries used, I would get a lot of dud data (sites hosting their own js files etc.).
Given more time, I feel as though I could have created a solid solution to get this task done. I felt my remainder time was better spent on the next task.

### Bonus Steps

#### 1

I was initially going to use TDD for this task but decided against it given how I was not entirely sure how I was going to approach some on the tasks at first glance.
If I did use TDD, I probably would have saved some time refactoring parts of my code to make it easier to write tests for. (Hindsight is 20/20)

#### 2

Multithreading would have been useful in speeding up the process of getting the HTML from the results pages and extracting the necessary data from them.

#### 3

I would have liked to have created a Class of Library with values of Name and Count, then adding them to an ArrayList and possibly using Comparable to sort them by the Count field.
